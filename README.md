## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API in my understanding is the ability to transfer data or information from of software to another. We interact with API when logging into a profile, checking the weather or posting on social media 
  

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API?

interface would be the transfer or information or data or instruction between two entities. similar to the example of the Remote and Television where the remote is responsible for isntructing or transfering information from the remote seleciton to the televisoin.

API falls under the bigger umbrella of interface as it is mostly the transfer between software


3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Endpoint - this is the location or specific path of the APi where the information we seek is located

Methods - These describe the actions that needs to be exectuted aginst the API endpoint. this includes:

GET: retrieves data 
POST: submit data
PUT: updates existing data
Delete: removes data 

Data Format: the layout of the data so that both the client and the server via APIS can read and understand the data. 
In other words is the translation of information so that server and client may understand each other during the interaction.

The two types of APIs Im fascinated about are Web APIs and Operating system APIs. Reason being they are the ones I identify as the two I most interact with. Most of the work I do (access clients credit reports, making electronic payments etc.) and recreational activities like gaming and streaming or social media utlise Web APIs and Operating System APIS


4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 
 
Going through the list of tools I do not think I have currently interactived with API exploration tools, This could be also due to it being the section I am still trying to grasp.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I am confident in the theory of what an API is and the basic function of it. I understand the definitions of the diffrent types of API. What I need to improve on is the practical side of APIs and understanding how the operate and their implementation to websites and applications.
